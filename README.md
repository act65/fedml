# Project Title: DEAI

## Overview

DEAI (Decentralized AI) is a research and experimentation platform focused on decentralized artificial intelligence and federated learning. It provides a flexible framework for simulating and deploying various decentralized learning scenarios, allowing users to explore the impact of different network topologies, communication strategies, and privacy-enhancing techniques on model training and performance.

## Features

*   **Flexible Network Topologies**:
    *   Support for common communication patterns including Ring, All-to-All (Fully Connected), and Centralized (Star) topologies.
*   **Pluggable Components**: Easily swap and experiment with different:
    *   **Datasets**: Integrate custom datasets for diverse learning tasks.
    *   **Models**: Use various model architectures suitable for federated learning.
    *   **Communication Policies**: Define how and when nodes communicate (e.g., periodic, synchronous).
    *   **Aggregation Strategies**: Implement different methods for combining model updates from multiple nodes.
    *   **Learning Algorithms**: Explore various decentralized and federated optimization algorithms.
*   **Privacy Mechanisms**: Incorporate and evaluate techniques to enhance data privacy during training (details to be expanded based on specific mechanisms implemented).
*   **Modular Design**: Built with flexibility in mind, allowing for easy extension and modification of core components.
*   **Configuration Management**: Utilizes Hydra for managing complex experimental configurations.

## Directory Structure

*   `deai/`: Contains the core source code for the DEAI framework, including modules for communication, training, data handling, models, and various pluggable components.
*   `configs/`: Holds configuration files, primarily for Hydra, defining parameters for experiments, network setups, and component choices.
*   `tests/`: Includes unit and integration tests for the DEAI framework to ensure code quality and correctness.
*   `scripts/`: Contains Python scripts for running experiments, simulations, and other operational tasks (e.g., `run_worker.py` for starting a worker node).
*   `deploy/`: (Potentially) Contains deployment scripts and configurations for running DEAI in distributed environments (e.g., Docker files, orchestration scripts).
*   `aws/`: (Potentially) Contains specific scripts or configurations for deploying or managing DEAI experiments on Amazon Web Services.

## Local Installation

Follow these steps to set up the DEAI project locally:

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.x (Python 3.8+ recommended)

### Steps

1.  **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url> # Replace <repository_url> with the actual URL
    cd deai
    ```

2.  **Create a Virtual Environment** (Recommended):
    Using `venv`:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
    Alternatively, you can use other tools like `conda`.

3.  **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(Note: Running tests locally is currently experiencing timeout issues under investigation. Instructions for running tests are omitted until resolved.)*

## Usage

The DEAI project uses [Hydra](https://hydra.cc/) for managing configurations. Experiments and simulations are typically run using scripts found in the `scripts/` directory.

For example, to run a worker node (depending on the specific scripts available):
```bash
python scripts/run_worker.py <configuration_options_via_hydra>
```
Refer to the specific scripts and their documentation (or use the `--help` flag if available) for detailed usage instructions and configuration options. Hydra allows for overriding configuration parameters directly from the command line.

## Contributing
